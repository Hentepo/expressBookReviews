      { isbn: "978-1-85326-000-2", author: "Jane Austen", title: "Pride and Prejudice", reviews: ["Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen is a timeless classic that explores themes of love, class, and societal expectations. The novel follows the intelligent and independent Elizabeth Bennet as she navigates the complexities of romance with the proud and seemingly aloof Mr. Darcy. Austen's wit and sharp commentary on social norms make this story both engaging and thought-provoking. The characters are richly developed, particularly Elizabeth and Darcy, whose evolving relationship forms the heart of the narrative. With its keen observations and memorable dialogue, Pride and Prejudice remains a captivating exploration of human nature and relationships."] },
